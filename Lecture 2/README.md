## Part 0: Review

- Course mechanics
  - Activities: Group + Individual (at home),
  - Due before next lecture
  - Approach: We try to present the material in an object-based approach (not OOP), therefore we will not use inheritance etc.s
- Previous lecture:
  - [Abstract Data Types(ADT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type)
  - [Data Structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)
  - **Array-based** [Stacks](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/stack-in-cpp/)
  - **Array-based** [Queues](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/queue-in-cpp/)

## Part 1: Brute Force, Decrease-and-Conquer

- Algorithm techniques:
  - [Brute Force](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/brute-force-approach-and-its-pros-and-cons/): [Linear Search](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/searching-algorithms-in-cpp/) of lists
  - [Decrease-and-Conquer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decrease-and-conquer/):
    - [Binary Search](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/searching-algorithms-in-cpp/) of sorted lists
    - [Running time of binary search](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/binary-search/a/running-time-of-binary-search)
- [Recursion vs Iteration](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-recursion-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/)
