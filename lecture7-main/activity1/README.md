# Activities

## Task 1:

- Answer at least 5 questions from the following link. Make sure you write the question as well as the answer.

> You can refer to [link #2](#links) below for more info.


Given a subset S of the vertices in a graph, when all vertices in S connect to all other vertices in S, this is called a:
- sparse matrix
- clique // correct answer
- directed graph
- None of the above

Two vertices can be adjacent even if they are not neighbors.
- True
- False // correct answer

The number of edges incident to that vertex called its:
- count
- number
- size
- degree // correct answer
- None of the above

A complete graph is a clique of size:
- |n|
- n
- |V| // correct answer
- None of the above

A free tree is:
- an unconnected graph with no cycles
- a connected graph with no cycles // correct answer
- a connected graph with only simple cycles

## Task 2

- Discuss how depth-first search works by experimenting with the following link. Try both directed and undirected graphs and write a short summary.

> You can refer to [link #3](#links) below for more info.

Summary:
- Directed depth-first search works by following clear directions going from point a -> b
- Undirected works by finding the closest available 'b' point as a guide for direction

## Task 3

- Discuss how breadth-first search works by experimenting with the following link. Try both directed and undirected graphs and write a short summary.

> You can refer to [link #4](#links) below for more info.

## Task 4:

- Reproduce the behavior of the BFS algorithm for the following graph:

> You can refer to [link #4](#links) below.

## Task 5: Individual (at home)

- There are two traditional approaches to representing graphs: The adjacency matrix and the adjacency list. What are the main differences in term of space/time complexity. You can refer to following link:
