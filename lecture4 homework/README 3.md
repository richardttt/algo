````
-The Sequential Search algorithm is in O(n2): True
-What is the smallest integer kk such that nlognnlogn is in O(nk)O(n​k​​)? : 2
-What is the smallest integer k such that sqrt(n) is in O(n^k)? : 1
-For sequential search, the best case occurs when: The search target is near the front of the array
