## Task 1

Watch this video (~2min):

Discuss the difference between:

- Queue vs Stack
  Queues are FIFO and Stacks are LIFO
  Queues are good for ensure order of processing , stack are good for quick insertion.
  Queues are double pointers and stacks are single pointers.

  POP in arrays: removes the last element added to the stack.
  Deque in queue will delete the first element added to the stack.
- LIFO vs FIFO
    Last in first out : LIFO referes to the operation that the last item added to the stack is accessed first.
    FIFO: First in first out, referes to the idea that first element added to the stack is accessed first.

## Task 2
