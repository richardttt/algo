# Activities

## Task 1

Refer to the following link. Discuss how the Recursive Fibonacci with Memoization works:
https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/DPFib.html

  - For larger values of n, recurssion with memoization reduces the time compelxity as we are re-using the  previously calculated sub-problems. Memoization is top-down approach to tackle problem.

## Task 2

The stair case problem can be solved based on the Fibonacci series. There is a simple implementations in `./src/staircase2.cpp`.

- Explain how the code works. The following link might be useful:

- Modify the code to use Dynamic Programming (Memoization)

## Task 3

Explain how the code in `./src/staircase3.cpp` works.

## Task 4: Individual (at home)

- There are `n` stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. Write a program that counts the number of ways someone can climb up to m stairs for a given value m. For example, if m is 4, it is possible to climb 1 stair or 2 stairs or 3 stairs or 4 stairs at a time. Make sure you use. Refer to the link below:
