# Activities

## Task 1: Tree Definition

  https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/Exercises/Binary/DefSumm.html

## Task 2

- Explain how the code in ./src/bt.cpp works. Refer to the following link:
  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-array-implementation/

## Task 3: Tree Traversal

Refer to te following links. Discuss the difference between the different ways binary trees can be traversed.

- [Pre-order Traversal](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/AV/Binary/btTravPreorderPRO.html)
- [Post-order Traversal](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/AV/Binary/btTravPostorderPRO.html)
- [In-order Traversal](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/AV/Binary/btTravInorderPRO.html)

## Task 4: Individual (at home)

- Answer at least 5 questions from the following link. Make sure you write the question as well as the answer.
  https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/Exercises/Binary/TravSumm.html

  - Q1: Why does function preorder2() presented in the Traversal module make only half as many recursive calls as function preorder()?


    Because there are half as many leaf nodes
    [x] Because half of the pointers are null
    Because there are half as many nodes
    Because only internal nodes get called
  
  - Q2: Visiting each element in a tree is known as:

        Merging
        Inserting
      [x]Traversing
        Enumerating
        Sorting
  - Q3: When you print out the nodes of binary tree, the leaf nodes appear in the same relative order for the preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals.

       [X] True
           False
  - Q4: Why does function preorder2() presented in the Traversal module make only half as many recursive calls as function preorder()?

          Because only internal nodes get called
        [x]Because half of the pointers are null
          Because there are half as many leaf nodes
          Because there are half as many nodes
  - Q5: The n nodes in a binary tree can be visited in:

        O(1) time
        O(log n) time 
    [x] O(n) time
        O(n log n) time
        O(n^2) time

- Answer at least 5 questions from the following link. Make sure you write the question as well as the answer.
