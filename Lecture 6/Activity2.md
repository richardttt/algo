# Activities

## Task 1

- Refer to the following link. Discuss how Binary Search Trees work:
  https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BST.html

## Task 2

- Refer to the following link.
  https://iq.opengenus.org/time-and-space-complexity-of-binary-search-tree/

Discuss the Time and Space complexity of Binary Search Tree (BST) operations (Searching, Insertion, Deletion) in the Best case, average case and worst case.

## Task 3

- Explain how the code in ./src/bst.cpp works. Refer to the following link:
  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-binary-search-tree-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/

## Task 4: Individual (at home)

- Refer to te following link. Explain how In-order Traversal is used to print a binary search tree.
  https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/Books/Everything/html/BinaryTreeTraversal.html#inorder-traversal

- Inorder traversal
First, visit all the nodes in the left subtree (root->left).
Then the root node (root->data) and finally Visit all the nodes in the right subtree  (root->right).The binary search tree makes use of this traversal to print all nodes in ascending order of value.
